The following sections contain proposal type dependent code. These would need
to be modified in order to support a new proposal type.

connector.py - proposal_add(self, prop_type)
  Will need to add new prop type in the list that verifies prop_type.

Database
  In table `cycles`:
  * Create new entry with a `type` that is of the new type.
  In table `options`:
  * Create new entries for `cycle_` + cyclename, and 
    `propno_` + cyclename to track the current cyclename for
    that proposal type and to track a new proposal number counter
    for that proposal type.

POSSIBLE RACE CONDITIONS - do we need to add table locking for these 
  operations?

  * Proposal ADD - Creates a proposal and let autoincrement value choose
    the propid. The proposal add db routine then follows it with an 
    immediate select in order to get the propid so it can add the
    propinfo, author, and source inital data. There could be a race
    condition between the initial add and the initial select.

    POTENTIALLY SOLVED - Switched to use LAST_INSERT_ID()

TODO FIX
  proposal_add - on successful proposal add, refresh to the proposal edit page
  edit_entry - make sure id is valid for repeat section types.

FAST MODES

  The following modes in the fast system exist:

  The Format for these modes are:
  SUBARRAY_BAND_POL_CORRCONF

    SUBARRAY can be: SCI1 , SCI2
    BAND     can be: 1CM, 3MM, 1MM
    POL      can be: SP (singlepol), DP (dualpol), FP (fullpol), C23 (Carma23), MAX (MAXSENS mode)
    CORRCONF can be: WB, SL, CO, HCO+
      WB is all wideband at specified frequency
      SL is 7 (or 3) wideband and 1 user specified spectral line freq and bw
      CO is 5 (or 1) wideband and 3 spectral line in 3mm or 1mm band (12CO, 13CO, C18O) with a custom bandwidth
      HCO+ is 1 wideband and 7 (or 3) spectral line in 3mm band with a custom bandwidth:
              for singlepol - (N2H+, HCN, HCO+, NH2D, CS H13CO+, H13CN)
              for carma23   - (N2H+, HCN, HCO+)
