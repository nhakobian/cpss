<h2 class="center">Fast-track Proposals</h2>

Welcome to the CARMA Proposal System. This system is used to propose
for Fast-track Time on the CARMA array. If you
have comments, encounter difficulties, or need help, please send an
email to: <a href="mailto:proposal-help@astro.illinois.edu">
proposal-help@astro.illinois.edu</a>

<ul>
  <li>Please login if directed to below.</li>
  <li>Read the disclaimer.</li>
  <li>Click on the button to create a new DDT proposal.</li>
</ul>

This will add a new Fast-track proposal to your list of proposals that you can then
edit and submit as you would a standard CARMA proposal. Once you submit a fast-track
proposal you cannot edit it as it is entered directly into the CARMA project database.
