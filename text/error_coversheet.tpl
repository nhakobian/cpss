A LaTeX error has occurred on the generated coversheet. This usually is caused by a 
LaTeX character in your title, author information, or abstract that is not correctly
escaped. Most commonly, '&' is used instead of '\&', or '%' instead of '\%'. Also
note, that non-ASCII characters are currently not supported. If you are still
receiving this error, please contact the Proposal-help team 
<proposal-help@astro.illinois.edu> for more assistance.
