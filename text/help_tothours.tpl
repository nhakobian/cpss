<div class="helptext">
  The total number of hours is calculated by adding up how many hours
  per source you have requested, by multiplying Hours Requested by the
  number of array configurations you requested the source to be
  observed in. For example, if you requested a single source to be
  observed in the A, B, C, and D arrays for 8 hours, the Total Hours
  will be 32.
