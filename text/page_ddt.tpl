<h2 class="center">DDT Proposals</h2>

Welcome to the CARMA Proposal System. This system is used to propose
for Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) on the CARMA array. If you
have comments, encounter difficulties, or need help, please send an
email to: <a href="mailto:proposal-help@astro.illinois.edu">
proposal-help@astro.illinois.edu</a>

<ul>
  <li>Please login if directed to below.</li>
  <li>Read the disclaimer.</li>
  <li>Click on the button to create a new DDT proposal.</li>
</ul>

This will add a new DDT to your list of proposals which you can then
edit and submit as you would a standard CARMA proposal.
