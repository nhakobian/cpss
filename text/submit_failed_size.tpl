  Submission Failed!<br><br>
  The size of the final PDF file is over the limit that the submission
  system can handle. The usual cause of this is using large bitmapped
  images in your proposal. One way of reducing this size is to reduce
  the resolution of your source image. If you still have a problem,
  please contact someone at proposal-help@astro.uiuc.edu.  Click <a
  href="proposal/edit/%s">here</a> to continue.
