Welcome to the CARMA Proposal System. This system is used to propose
for time on the CARMA array during TAC-approved proposal calls. If you
have comments, or encounter difficulties and need help, please send
email to: <a href="mailto:proposal-help@astro.uiuc.edu">
proposal-help@astro.uiuc.edu</a>
<br>
<br>

Information for proposers, including a link to information on the
CARMA Array status, is available at: <a href="http://www.mmarray.org/">
www.mmarray.org</a>
<br>
<br>

The CARMA Proposal System will ask you to establish an account for
your proposals. You can work on proposals and save partial and draft
results, and come back later to edit and finish your proposals. Old
proposals will be kept on the system as reference.
<br>
<br>

Most people try to write proposals the last day or last hour before
the deadline. Be aware that things may be very busy near the deadline,
with the proposal computer response slower than normal and our ability
to help you with problems in time for you to meet the deadline
reduced. It would be to your advantage to get proposals into the
system as early as possible. Even after you submit a proposal, you can
come back and revise it anytime before the deadline, so getting a
complete proposal in early insures that you will meet the deadline
without compromising your ability to make last minute changes.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Scientific and Technical Justification</h3>

This part of the proposal is strictly limited to 3 pages, 2 pages of
text and 1 page of figures and tables. One way to enter this
information is to type or paste LaTex into the Scientific
Justification and Technical Justification sections. The 
<a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AAS/AASTeX/">AASTeX<a> system
is fully supported. Postscript figures may be uploaded for inclusion
using standard LaTex figure conventions. When you submit, the proposal
system will compile your LaTex and display a PDF file on your screen
for you to check (make sure the total justification is no more than 3
pages).
<br>
<br>

If you wish to have more control over your justification section, you
may upload a completed LaTeX file. You are required to use our <a
href="static/justification.tar.gz"> template</a>. Please follow the
guidelines listed below for the justification sections. Non-compliant
proposals will not be forwarded to the TAC.  

<ul>
  <li>
    2 Pages of text, no embedded figures.
  </li>
  <li>
    1 Page for figures, tables, and references.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do Not change the style sheet, or amend margins, type face, line spacing,
    etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Projects</h3>

If you are submitting a proposal for a Key Project, the justification
requirements are different. <b>Make sure you select the 'Key Project'
option listed in the 'General Proposal Information' section. Adjustments
to the length of key projects are listed below.</b> For more information
about these projects, visit the <a 
href="http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/observing/proposals/KP_call2011b.html">Key
Project</a> page. For the Key Project justification, you must upload a
LaTeX file containing the content. We provide a <a
href="static/justification_key.tar.gz">template</a> that you must
adhere to in order for your proposal to be considered (this template
is slightly different that the one for standard proposals).

<ul>
  <li>
    Proposal text (5 pages maximum):<br> 

    The proposal text must contain the following information:<br>

    a) Scientific Justification and anticipated scientific impact of
        the proposed observations.<br>

    b) Technical justification, including the timeline for the
        proposed observations. <br> 

    c) Management. This section should provide a plan for the overall
       management of the project. This should include (i) a
       description of the data products and data release plans, (ii)
       key benchmarks covering the duration of the project against
       which progress may be gauged, and (iii) how the project team
       will contribute to CARMA operations and provide regular
       feedback on data quality.
  </li><br>

  <li>
      Figures, Table, and References (3 pages maximum):<br>

      If the proposer needs help inputing a large number of sources into the
      source configuration section, please contact the Proposal Help email
      address. The total time for the project per configuration
      per semester must be clearly indicated.
  </li>
</ul>

If your proposal is accepted and observations are successful, we ask
that you acknowledge CARMA in relevant publications and lectures. The
form for acknowledgement in papers is on the CARMA website. Please
also advise Mary Daniel (mary @ mmarray.org) of any publications that
use CARMA data.
