  A short, simple, descriptive name for the object that you are
  observing.

<a name="ra" />
<div class="helptitle">Right Ascension</div>
<div class="helptext">
  Please give coordinates to the object or region that you are
  observing in J2000 format. If your proposal is accepted, you will be
  able to give more accurate coordinates at that time. Make sure that
  your Right Ascension is in the format HH MM or HH:MM.

<a name="dec" />
<div class="helptitle">Declination</div>
<div class="helptext">
  Please give the Declination of the object you are observing. See the
  restrictions and notes for Right Ascension above.

  this source?

<a name="species" />
<div class="helptitle">Species / Transition Name</div>
<div class="helptext">
  If these are molecular line observations what species and transition

<a name="self_cal" />
<div class="helptitle">Can Self-Calibrate</div>
<div class="helptext">
  Can your source be self-calibrated?

<a name="min_max" />          
<div class="helptitle">Time Requested</div>
<div class="helptext">
  How long are you requesting to observe this obsblock in hours (this
  time includes your source(s) and any calibrators observed), per
  array configuration?  If the time requested is longer than can be
  accomodated in a single track, the observation will be on multiple
  days. Track lengths will depend on declination and whether the
  project is primarily an imaging project, or requires the best
  SNR. See <a
  href="http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/observing/doc/instrument_desc.html"
  target="_blank">this page</a> for more details.
</div>

<a name="imaging" />
<div class="helptitle">Imaging/SNR</div>
<div class="helptext">
  If the aim of this obsblock is to get the most complete UV coverage
  (and thus the best image possible) then select IMAGE. For detection
  projects, or other projects where signal to noise is critical,
  select SNR. Such projects can often be observed in smaller pieces or
  off transit to increase the scheduling efficiency of the
  telescope. To allow this, and receive compensation in the form of
  increased observation time will be made if you elect this option.
