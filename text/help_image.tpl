  Use the images section to attach any images to your proposal. The
  images must be in postscript (PS or EPS) format. If you upload any
  other type of image, you will get an error when you attempt to view
  the PDF of your proposal.  If you need to make any adjustments to
  the attached image (i.e.  rotation, scale, cropping) please refer to
  the documentation for the LaTeX package graphicx. The maximum file
  size for an image is ~14MB.
